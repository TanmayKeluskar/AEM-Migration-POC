                           <li></li>
                           <li><span>- Where changes are published simultaneously but have more than one operative date, the latest operative date is shown in either the "Operative Date" column, at the end of the paragraph or note, or at the bottom of the page. The earlier operative date may be annotated (by use of a note reference after the text relating to a note stating the operative date for that service). </span></li>

                           <li><span>- Where a further change with a new operative date is made to a page already showing italics, all previous italics on the page will be removed and only the new/amended information will be italicised.</span></li>
